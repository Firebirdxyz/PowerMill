# PowerMill
My name is Konstantin and welcome to my repository. 
Here I publish plugins and extensions for Autodesk PowerMill.
Any of these are wrote on C# using PowerMill PluginFramework.

**PowerMill Plugin template** to help you to create a plugin from scratch. I've created Plugin template according to MVVM plugin. 
PPT supports multipage views and corresponding vewmodels. Any of these VMs are able to notify each other via Messanger service. More info [see article on Codeprojet](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/173618/MVVM-sharp-Episode-1)
I also added a project to the solution to host your plugin standalone, without PowerMill running. 
Further work is dedicated to add an installation functionality.
